## What and how they fund

https://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio/grantmaking-approach/

> The mission of Good Ventures is to help humanity thrive, and we want to take the fullest possible advantage of the opportunity we have to serve others. That’s why the goal of our giving is to do as much good as we can — in other words, to improve as many lives as possible as much as possible. We are committed to learning from our successes and shortcomings, to sharing what we’re learning with others, and to being an outstanding partner to the organizations we support.
> 
> ## Our Partners
> 
> Currently, Good Ventures does not employ full-time staff. Instead, we rely on the research and recommendations of two organizations with which we partner closely: [Open Philanthropy](http://www.openphilanthropy.org/) and [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/).
> 
> Open Philanthropy advises major donors on how to maximize the impact of their giving. Its mission is to help others as much as possible with its available resources.
> 
> GiveWell finds outstanding giving opportunities and publishes the full details of its analysis to help donors decide where to give. It recommends a small number of “top charities” that deliver evidence-backed, cost-effective, and scalable programs.
> 
> ## Our Focus Areas
> 
> Our grantmaking in partnership with Open Philanthropy focuses on causes that stand out on three criteria: **importance**, **neglectedness**, and **tractability**. Current major focus areas include:
> 
> - Abundance and economic growth
> - Biosecurity and pandemic preparedness
> - Economic growth in low- and middle-income countries
> - Effective giving & careers
> - Farm animal welfare
> - Forecasting
> - Global aid policy
> - Global catastrophic risks capacity building
> - Global health and development
> - Global health R&D
> - Global public health policy
> - Potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence
> - Scientific research
> 
> In choosing focus areas, Open Philanthropy casts a wide net, considering a wide variety of causes and incorporating [lessons from the history of philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/history-of-philanthropy/) as well as [the work of other major foundations today](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/what-large-scale-philanthropy-focuses-on-today/). Learn more about how Open Philanthropy chooses focus areas [here](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/cause-selection/).
> 
> Our grantmaking in partnership with GiveWell focuses on global health and development; we support both GiveWell’s [top charities](http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) and some of the [other work](https://www.givewell.org/all-grants-fund) they fund.
