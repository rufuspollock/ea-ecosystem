[[Forethought]] AI pivot in 2025 funded by two HNW individuals  according to their [[clippings/Forethought A new AI macrostrategy group - EA Forum|announce post on EA Forum]]

> We have funding through to approximately March 2026 at our current size, from two high-net-worth donors.

NB: team looks to be about 9 people. Average salary based on info on their advertised job openings was \$100-150k plus "generous benefits" so probably around \$1.5m once we allow for overheads.
