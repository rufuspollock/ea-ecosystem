EA is surprisingly well-funded for a movement that is barely 20y old and which was originally based in academic philosophy.

This leads us to ask: how is the EA ecosystem funded? In particular: Who funds it? How do they do it? And where does the money go?

> "Who" and "how" are obviously difficult questions to answer in any precise way: there are many sources including individual donors and even for large donors we don't have (very) good open philanthropic data. All we can do is make some educated guesses and use the little open data we do have (see below). The following should therefore be taken as a very loose hypothesis and stimulus to further discussion.

The Effective Altruism ecosystem is primarily funded through major philanthropic sources connected to the technology and finance sectors. Open Philanthropy, backed by Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna, is by far the largest funder, having committed billions of dollars to EA-aligned initiatives. Other early funders include GiveWell‚Äôs founders and private individuals like Jaan Tallinn. EA‚Äôs ‚Äúearning to give‚Äù ethos has also generated well-off adherents who then direct capital back into EA projects, though not without controversy. Overall, a first guess would be that a major part of the funding stream comes from a relatively small number of ultra-wealthy technologists and financiers supplemented by a larger community of medium to small sized supports.

## Longer

One important source of funds is is that from quite early on (early/mid 2010s?), [[Open Philanthropy]] ‚Äîcreated and funded by Dustin Moskovitz, one of the co-founders of Facebook and the co-founder of Asana‚Äîhas dedicated a large portion of its resources toward Effective Altruism. They even hired [[Holden Karnofsky]] one of the original founders of [[GiveWell]] as a CEO. Then there‚Äôs [[Jaan Tallinn]] and various other figures.

Second, in general the EA ecosystem is attractive to the technocapitalist world in which we live‚Äîthe kind of engineering mindset it embodies is very aligned with that.

It has also had a model that encourages ‚Äúearning to give,‚Äù and quite a bit of that money has flowed back into the ecosystem. The most notorious example is Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, who, in some sense, justified what he was doing as earning to give back into EA and was seeking to found one of the major EA-backed philanthropies.

That‚Äôs one partial answer to the ‚Äúhow.‚Äù
